## How to install

- Download `SmartHunter.exe` and `Newtonsoft.Json.dll` from here https://github.com/gabrielefilipp/SmartHunter/tree/master/SmartHunter/bin/Debug.
- Place them in a new folder.
- IMPORTANT: If you are replacing the new `.exe` in the same folder of the old SmartHunter please just follow the instructions `## How to update`.

## How to update

- Following the commit https://github.com/gabrielefilipp/SmartHunter/commit/305b8a55eb4cd40c31a06a30ab862b4f803baa84 I've added an AutoUpdater module to this Application.
- To enable this feature just set the key 'AutomaticallyCheckAndDownloadUpdates' to 'true', if present, otherwise just add it, to the file `Config.json`.
- NOTE that this feature is already active if it's the first time you follow the "How to install" steps and download the mentioned files in a new directory.
- To force an update just delete the file `Versions.json` and restart the application.

## How to create and use new localizations

- Create a copy of `en-US.json` and rename it for the locale you are translating to.
- Translate the strings in the second part of each key value pair. Do not change the keys.
- Ensure the new file is in the SmartHunter folder.
- Open `Config.json` and point `LocalizationFileName` to the new file.

## How to create and use new skins

- Create a copy of `Default.xaml` and rename it appropriately.
- Make changes to the new file.
- Ensure the new file is in the SmartHunter folder.
- Open `Config.json` and point `SkinFileName` to the new file.

## Disclaimer

Use with care and at your own risk. It is possible to get banned from games for using mods and overlays. There have been reports of people being banned from other games, such as PUBG, if overlays are accidentally left running in the background. To date, there have been no reports of players being banned from Monster Hunter: World for using mods and overlays, but that doesn't preclude it from happening in the future.
